    }
?>

<?php
    # Update the cookies

    setcookie($cookie_name, $cookie_Uptaded_value, time() + 3600);
    echo "<br>";
    echo "Updated Value is: " . $_COOKIE[$cookie_name];
?>

<?php
    // Delete the cookies 
    setcookie("user", "", time() - 3600);
    echo "<br>";
    echo "Cookie 'user' has been deleted.";

?>

2.	Implement the PHP code to Manage the session

-	Destroying session

<?php
    // Starting session
    session_start();
    echo "Session has been started.<br>";

    $_SESSION["username"] = "DS";

    // Accessing session values
    if(isset($_SESSION["username"])) {
        echo "Session variable 'username' is set with the value: " . $_SESSION["username"] . "<br>";
    } else {
        echo "Session variable 'username' is not set.<br>";
    }

    // Destroy the session
    session_unset();
    session_destroy();
    echo "Session has been destroyed.";
?>


3.	Implement the PHP code to find how many times the page is visited 


<?php
    session_start();

    if(isset($_SESSION['views'])) {
        $_SESSION['views'] = $_SESSION['views'] + 1;
    } else {
        $_SESSION['views'] = 1;
    }

    echo "This page is visited " . $_SESSION['views'] . " times.";
?>



4.	Implement the PHP code to demonstrate the expiry of session by clicking logout or back button)
4.php
<?php

    session_start();
    session_unset();
    session_destroy();
    echo "Session has been destroyed. Redirecting to login page...";
    header("refresh:2;url=login.php"); 
    exit();
?>

Login.php
<?php
    echo "Login Page";
?>

5.	Implement the PHO code to demonstrate the use of $_SERVER to find the details of name of server, name of the script, IP address of server, name of the request method, name of the protocol

<?php
    echo "Server Name: " . $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] . "<br>";
    echo "Script Name: " . $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] . "<br>";
    echo "Server IP Address: " . $_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR'] . "<br>";
    echo "Request Method: " . $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] . "<br>";
    echo "Protocol: " . $_SERVER['SERVER_PROTOCOL'] . "<br>";
?>
